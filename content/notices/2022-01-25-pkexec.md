On Tuesday, January 25th, 2022, [Qualys published a blog post detailing an issue they identified](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/01/25/pwnkit-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-discovered-in-polkits-pkexec-cve-2021-4034) within pkexec, a core component of polkit (formerly known as PolicyKit). In the time since Qualys disclosed this issue, [exploit code](https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c) has been made available. Bug Alert's volunteer team believes, but has not yet confirmed, that this vulnerability would also allow for container escape in Docker or Kubernetes environments, which could be especially damaging in shared infrastructure systems like CI/CD or shared application runtime environments. This post will be updated as more information becomes available.


PwnKit, as this vulnerability is being called, has been assigned CVE-2021-4034. Patches are available now for most Linux distributions.
