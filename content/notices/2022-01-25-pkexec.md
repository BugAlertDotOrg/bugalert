On Tuesday, January 25th, 2022, [Qualys published a blog post detailing an issue they identified](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/01/25/pwnkit-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-discovered-in-polkits-pkexec-cve-2021-4034) within pkexec, a core component of polkit (formerly known as PolicyKit). In the time since Qualys disclosed this issue, [exploit code](https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c) has been made available. The pkexec binary is _most commonly_ installed with Linux GUI components and may not be present on servers that run 'minimal' OS installs. This post will be updated as more information becomes available.


PwnKit, as this vulnerability is being called, has been assigned CVE-2021-4034. Patches are available now for most Linux distributions.
