On Wednesday, March 16th, 2022, cri-o announced in a [security advisory](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-6x2m-w449-qwx7) that cri-o version 1.19 and above could be exploited by an attacker to break out of containers and obtain root access to the host. [CRI-O](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-cri-o-10) is an alternative to Docker in Kubernetes environment. A user with rights to deploy a pod on a Kubernetes cluster that uses the CRI-O runtime can abuse the “kernel.core_pattern” kernel parameter to achieve container escape and arbitrary code execution as root on any node in the cluster.This attack is dubbed "cr8escape".  

The researchers that discovered the vulnerability [state](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cr8escape-new-vulnerability-discovered-in-cri-o-container-engine-cve-2022-0811/) that Kubernetes is not necessary to invoke the vulnerability. 

Workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability are provided in the ghitub security advisory linked above.
