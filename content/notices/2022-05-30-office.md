On Monday, May 30th, 2022, [security researcher Kevin Beaumont published a blog post](https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e) detailing an exploit, 'Follina', that had been discovered three days prior and discussed at length on Twitter. This exploit abuses the template retrieval mechanism in Microsoft Office installations on Microsoft Windows systems to initiate arbitrary PowerShell code. Microsoft has not yet acknowledged this issue, and there is no patch. This exploit has been actively used against Russia-based targets for over a month.

Exploit code is widely available online, and weaponization of this vulnerability by groups _other than_ the original authors is likely already underway. While awaiting patches from Microsoft, the best course of action is to monitor for use of this exploit and provide user education. Signatures for various detection tools have been made available and are linked from Kevin Beaumont's post.

This vulnerability has not yet been assigned a CVE, but this post will be updated when one is assigned.
