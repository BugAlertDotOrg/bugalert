Date: 2022-10-01 12:00
Category: Services & System Applications
Tags: OpenSSL, Critical Severity, CVE-2022-XXXXX
Slug: openssl
Summary: A trivally-exploited remote code execution vulnerability has been found in OpenSSL, and patches are now available. The flaw has been assigned a bug alert severity of 'critical'.
---

[OpenSSL has confirmed the existence of the remote code execution vulnerability in versions between 3.0.0 and 3.0.6](https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#y2022). Patches are now available from OpenSSL, though major Linux distributions have not yet added updated packages to their repositories.

Introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.0, <PLACEHOLDER FOR THE ISSUE>. This can be utilized by an attacker to <PLACEHOLDER> and execute code on the server.

The major cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP) do not utilize OpenSSL on their load balancers. If you terminate TLS on a cloud provider load balancer, workloads behind them running vulnerable versions of OpenSSL are not at risk of compromise.

Linux distributions that **are** vulnerable:

| Linux Distro | OpenSSL Version |
| -- | -- |
| Alpine Unstable (edge) | 3.0.5 |
| CentOS Stream 9 | 3.0.1 |
| Debian Unstable (sid) | 3.0.5 |
| Fedora 36 | 3.0.5 |
| Fedora Rawhide | 3.0.5 |
| Kali 2022.3 | 3.0.5 |
| Linux Mint 21 Vanessa | 3.0.2 |
| Redhat ES 9 | 3.0 |
| Rocky Linux 9.0 (Blue Onyx) | 3.0.1 |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | 3.0.2 |


Linux distributions that are *not* vulnerable (use a version of OpenSSL < 3.0):
| Linux Distro | OpenSSL Version |
| -- | -- |
| Alpine Linux 3.16 | 1.1.1 |
| CentOS 7 | 1.0.2 |
| CentOS 8 | 1.1.1 |
| Debian 11 (bullseye) | 1.1.1 |
| Fedora 34 | 1.1.1 |
| Fedora 35 | 1.1.1 |
| OpenSuSE Leap 15.2 | 1.1.1 |
| OpenSuSE Leap 15.3 | 1.1.1 |
| OpenSuSE Leap 15.4 | 1.1.1 |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | 1.1.1 |
