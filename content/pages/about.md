####Bug Alert is a resource for the security community, acting as a notification service for high-impact and 0day vulnerabilities.####
Hi, I'm Matthew Sullivan, a security practitioner, and the creator of Bug Alert.


When the Log4j vulnerability was first discovered, it was reported, as most are, on Twitter. 12 hours passed before I would spot the post
on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) which detailed the critical issue. By then, precious time for reacting had been completely
lost; it was nearly midnight in my local timezone, and all the people I needed to mobilize were already in bed.

There is no central clearinghouse for notifying security professionals about critical security issues. The process for issuing security
bulletins from organizations like the [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/) are both welcomed and well-intentioned, but by the time a CVE identifier
has been issued, or a bulletin posted, it's simply too late.

Bug Alert has exactly one goal: early notification for serious flaws in software. This process is conducted entirely in the open, via
our project on [GitHub](https://github.com/sullivanmatt/SpicyVulns). Contributions are not only encouraged; worldwide assistance is going
to be required if this project is to succeed.
