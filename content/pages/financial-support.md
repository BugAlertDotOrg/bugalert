title: Financial Support

As Bug Alert grows, it will be a moderately costly service to run. If a subscriber receives a notice using all three methods (email, SMS, phone), that notice will cost approximately $0.20 USD to send. Multiply that by, say, 10,000 subscribers, and we find that this notice suddenly costs $2,000 USD to send.

I want to take a wait-and-see approach to fundraising; if there is significant interest, I may consider something like Patreon for supporting the service. For now, though, if you would like to offer one-time financial support, feel free to donate via Venmo: [https://venmo.com/u/sullivanmatt](https://venmo.com/u/sullivanmatt). If you are a company and you are interested in sponsoring the site, I'm very open to discussing an arrangement inspired by [Troy Hunt's sponsorship method](https://www.troyhunt.com/sponsorship/); feel free to shoot me an email and we can discuss. My various ways of being reached can be found on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/matthewsullivan).
