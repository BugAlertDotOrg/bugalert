We have a new phone number as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls and texts will now come from &lt;strong&gt;+1 (507) 668-8567&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;+1 (507) NOVULNS 😉&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A celebration!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bug Alert launched in January 2022, it was hard to imagine having even a few hundred people as part of our community. Today, we serve notices to thousands of people all across the world, and continue to stand at the ready to make a positive difference in the security community. Thank you for your continued support, and we're so glad to be bringing the entire Bug Alert feature set to our worldwide community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got this test notice by SMS (we didn't fire off phone calls for this one), feel free to take a screen shot and post it in celebration on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/BugAlertDotOrg/bugalert/pull/73"&gt;GitHub pull request for this notice&lt;/a&gt;! We especially want to celebrate a (hopefully) successful test with anyone who lives outside of North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A few housekeeping items:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also seen an increase in email notices going to Spam folders; if you would please check your spam and mark any Bug Alert messages as 'safe', it would help the project immensely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug Alert is happy to continue serving the Twitter community, but I (Matthew Sullivan, Founder) remain concerned about Twitter's long-term prospects. A significant number of security professionals have adopted the &lt;a href="https://infosec.exchange/"&gt;Infosec Exchange Mastodon server&lt;/a&gt; as their new home. Bug Alert runs on volunteer time, but getting support for posting notices automatically on the Infosec Exchange Mastodon server will be a high priority, so that we can properly serve that community. If that's something you are interested in tackling, we'd be happy to accept a pull request to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally: if you received an email or SMS linking to this notice, and no longer wish to receive test notices (typically no more than one per quarter), please update &lt;a href="https://bugalert.org/content/pages/my-subscriptions.html"&gt;your Bug Alert subscription preferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Test"></category><category term="Twilio"></category></entry><entry><title>Multiple Vulnerabilities in Atlassian Products (CVE-2022-26136, CVE-2022-26137, CVE-2022-26138)</title><link href="https://bugalert.org/content/notices/2022-07-20-atlassian.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-20T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-20T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Bug Alert Contributors</name></author><id>tag:bugalert.org,2022-07-20:/content/notices/2022-07-20-atlassian.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Multiple Vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Atlassian Products. A hardcoded credential vulnerability in Questions for Confluence, and Servlet Filter Bypass Vulnerabilities have been found in multiple Atlassian products that may enable Authentication Bypasses, XSS Attacks, and CORS attacks. These vulnerabilities have been assigned a bug alert severity of 'very high'. Atlassian recommends patching affected installations immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, July 20th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/july-2022-atlassian-security-advisories-overview-1142446703.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that a hardcoded credential vulnerability exists in the Questions for Confluence application, as well as Servlet Filter bypasses in both first and third party applications tied to multiple Atlassian products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardcoded credential vulnerability stems from the use of the Questions for Confluence application with the &lt;code&gt;disabledsystemuser&lt;/code&gt; account. The fix here is to update the Questions for Confluence app to a non-vulnerable version, or to disable/delete this account. &lt;strong&gt;Uninstalling the Questions for Confluence application does not remediate this vulnerability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check for use of the &lt;code&gt;disabledsystemuser&lt;/code&gt; account, follow instructions found &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-get-a-list-of-users-with-their-last-logon-times-985499701.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is for the servlet bypasses, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. The current fix is to patch to the level indicated in the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If exploited, these servlet bypass vulnerabilities may enable attackers to perform an Authentication Bypass, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass.&lt;/p&gt;

This issue has been assigned a bug alert severity of 'high'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Monday, May 30th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e"&gt;security researcher Kevin Beaumont published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing an exploit, 'Follina', that had been discovered three days prior and discussed at length on Twitter. This exploit abuses the template retrieval mechanism in Microsoft Office installations on Microsoft Windows systems to initiate arbitrary code, using a vulnerability in Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT).
On May 30th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/"&gt;Microsoft acknowledged this issue&lt;/a&gt; and workarounds are available, but there is no patch. This exploit has been actively used against Russia-based targets for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploit code is widely available online, and weaponization of this vulnerability by groups &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; the original authors is likely already underway. While awaiting patches from Microsoft, the best course of action is to monitor for use of this exploit, provide user education and implement workarounds. Signatures for various detection tools have been made available and are linked from Kevin Beaumont's post. Microsoft has also released detections for Microsoft Defender. This post will be updated as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

This issue is likely easily exploited in common configurations. If confirmed, another notice will be sent out with a severity of 'critical'. While unconfirmed, the severity has been assigned 'high'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Update as of March 30th, 3:00PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/spring-core-jdk9-rce/"&gt;Praetorian has confirmed the existence of this RCE in a recently-published blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/content/notices/2022-03-30-spring.html"&gt;A new Bug Alert notice has been added here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update as of March 30th, 1:30PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bug Alert team is aware of claims of a PoC for a Spring core RCE. However, we are awaiting confirmation before raising any further alarms, and we have not been able to utilize the PoC successfully against real-world Spring installs that we have (legal) access to. Some security professionals have claimed, on Twitter, that they are able to utilize the PoC successfully against Spring instances running behind Tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the confusion, multiple Spring devs have publicly stated there is no known vulnerability within Spring Core, and they have also stated that yesterday's serialization-related code change &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt; an attempt a resolving an open security issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll share any further info as it comes in, but at this time we are taking a cautious approach with raising any further alarms. This is already a deeply confusing situation, and Bug Alert wants to avoid making it worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to remind readers that Bug Alert is intended to be one of the earliest sources of information, and we have to weigh the risks of being early, but being wrong. This may very well end up being a case where we are wrong, but in the moment it is hard to know what is accurate. We will continue to monitor the situation and report on new developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original notice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notice is intended to alert you that there &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be a significant issue with Spring which, if confirmed, would require immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning (New York time) on Tuesday, March 29th, 2022, a member of the security research team KnownSec posted a now-removed screenshot to Twitter purporting to show a trivially-exploited remote code execution vulnerability against Spring core, the most popular Java framework in use on the Internet. The researcher did not provide a proof-of-concept or public details. Since then, the Bug Alert team has been very closely monitoring activity and discussion in the Spring ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: the claims in the next paragraph have been refuted by the Spring team. I have left them visible for historical context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;del&gt;During our initial investigation, the Bug Alert volunteer team noted that a &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7f7fb58dd0dae86d22268a4b59ac7c72a6c22529#diff-6c2618839eda075efe4491842d3673eab8fe1e342f6d9ddc2bbda8556e595864L153"&gt;small change was introduced into the Spring codebase at roughly the same time&lt;/a&gt; which may be the patch for this particular remote code execution issue. The team believes RCE could be possible through this vector, and that this change is likely the change that is intended to resolve the issue in Spring. However, the Spring team has not yet commented and has locked/closed GitHub issues inquiring about the accuracy of the claims being made.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few minutes ago, Cyber Kendra, a cybersecurity blog, &lt;a href="https://www.cyberkendra.com/2022/03/springshell-rce-0-day-vulnerability.html"&gt;put up a new post&lt;/a&gt; detailing (translated) claims that have been circulating on Chinese blogs and media for the past several hours. This post also details some of the (unconfirmed) ways this vulnerability could be detected or mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notice is intended to prepare you for the possibility that a trivially-exploited remote code execution vulnerability may be present in one of the most widely-used pieces of open-source software. The impact of this vulnerability, if it does exist, would be significant; far in excess of the impact of Log4j or Heartbleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have feedback (did you agree/disagree that a notice should have been sent?) or questions, please comment on the discussion thread linked below. This notice cost the project approximately $50 USD to send.

This issue is likely easily exploited in common configurations. If confirmed, another notice will be sent out with a severity of 'critical'. While unconfirmed, the severity has been assigned 'high'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Update as of March 30th, 3:00PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/spring-core-jdk9-rce/"&gt;Praetorian has confirmed the existence of this RCE in a recently-published blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/content/notices/2022-03-30-spring.html"&gt;A new Bug Alert notice has been added here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update as of March 30th, 1:30PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bug Alert team is aware of claims of a PoC for a Spring core RCE. However, we are awaiting confirmation before raising any further alarms, and we have not been able to utilize the PoC successfully against real-world Spring installs that we have (legal) access to. Some security professionals have claimed, on Twitter, that they are able to utilize the PoC successfully against Spring instances running behind Tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the confusion, multiple Spring devs have publicly stated there is no known vulnerability within Spring Core, and they have also stated that yesterday's serialization-related code change &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt; an attempt a resolving an open security issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll share any further info as it comes in, but at this time we are taking a cautious approach with raising any further alarms. This is already a deeply confusing situation, and Bug Alert wants to avoid making it worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to remind readers that Bug Alert is intended to be one of the earliest sources of information, and we have to weigh the risks of being early, but being wrong. This may very well end up being a case where we are wrong, but in the moment it is hard to know what is accurate. We will continue to monitor the situation and report on new developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original notice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notice is intended to alert you that there &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be a significant issue with Spring which, if confirmed, would require immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning (New York time) on Tuesday, March 29th, 2022, a member of the security research team KnownSec posted a now-removed screenshot to Twitter purporting to show a trivially-exploited remote code execution vulnerability against Spring core, the most popular Java framework in use on the Internet. The researcher did not provide a proof-of-concept or public details. Since then, the Bug Alert team has been very closely monitoring activity and discussion in the Spring ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: the claims in the next paragraph have been refuted by the Spring team. I have left them visible for historical context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;del&gt;During our initial investigation, the Bug Alert volunteer team noted that a &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7f7fb58dd0dae86d22268a4b59ac7c72a6c22529#diff-6c2618839eda075efe4491842d3673eab8fe1e342f6d9ddc2bbda8556e595864L153"&gt;small change was introduced into the Spring codebase at roughly the same time&lt;/a&gt; which may be the patch for this particular remote code execution issue. The team believes RCE could be possible through this vector, and that this change is likely the change that is intended to resolve the issue in Spring. However, the Spring team has not yet commented and has locked/closed GitHub issues inquiring about the accuracy of the claims being made.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few minutes ago, Cyber Kendra, a cybersecurity blog, &lt;a href="https://www.cyberkendra.com/2022/03/springshell-rce-0-day-vulnerability.html"&gt;put up a new post&lt;/a&gt; detailing (translated) claims that have been circulating on Chinese blogs and media for the past several hours.

&lt;p&gt;Publicly available documentation is scarce, but the Bug Alert team has analyzed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Onapsis/onapsis_icmad_scanner/blob/master/src/ICMAD_scanner.py"&gt;the PoC&lt;/a&gt; and SAP documentation. It appears that SAP &lt;a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/e815bb97839a4d83be6c4fca48ee5777/7.5.21/en-US/4a47abb3e1f41cd4e10000000a421937.html"&gt;can utilize the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; header&lt;/a&gt; (which is usually stripped from untrusted traffic) to authenticate a user through an authenticating proxy or SSO module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, publicly available information is limited at this time, but it appears likely that this request smuggling issue could be utilized to insert the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; request header and impersonate another SAP user, including the present-by-default 'Administrator' account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-22536. Patches are available now from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
