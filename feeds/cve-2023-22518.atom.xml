&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, October 31st, 2023, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-confluence-server-1311473907.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that Confluence Server and Data Center editions are vulnerable to an authorization vulnerability which allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause significant data loss. Patches are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that a patch has been made available, it's likely that additional attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to remove Confluence Server and Data Center from being available from the Internet if they cannot be patched immediately, either by shutting them down, or by firewalling them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2023-22518.&lt;/p&gt;
