&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, October 31st, 2023, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-confluence-server-1311473907.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that Confluence Server and Data Center editions are vulnerable to an authorization vulnerability which allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause significant data loss. Patches are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that a patch has been made available, it's likely that additional attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to remove Confluence Server and Data Center from being available from the Internet if they cannot be patched immediately, either by shutting them down, or by firewalling them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2023-22518.&lt;/p&gt;

This issue can be exploited in the default configuration on Windows, and only requires the user be tricked into downloading a malicious file. There is no patch. This issue has been assigned a bug alert severity of 'high'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Monday, May 30th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/follina-a-microsoft-office-code-execution-vulnerability-1a47fce5629e"&gt;security researcher Kevin Beaumont published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing an exploit, 'Follina', that had been discovered three days prior and discussed at length on Twitter. This exploit abuses the template retrieval mechanism in Microsoft Office installations on Microsoft Windows systems to initiate arbitrary code, using a vulnerability in Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT).
On May 30th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/"&gt;Microsoft acknowledged this issue&lt;/a&gt; and workarounds are available, but there is no patch. This exploit has been actively used against Russia-based targets for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploit code is widely available online, and weaponization of this vulnerability by groups &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; the original authors is likely already underway. While awaiting patches from Microsoft, the best course of action is to monitor for use of this exploit, provide user education and implement workarounds. Signatures for various detection tools have been made available and are linked from Kevin Beaumont's post. Microsoft has also released detections for Microsoft Defender. This post will be updated as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-30190.&lt;/p&gt;

This issue is likely easily exploited in common configurations. If confirmed, another notice will be sent out with a severity of 'critical'. While unconfirmed, the severity has been assigned 'high'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Update as of March 30th, 3:00PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.praetorian.com/blog/spring-core-jdk9-rce/"&gt;Praetorian has confirmed the existence of this RCE in a recently-published blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/content/notices/2022-03-30-spring.html"&gt;A new Bug Alert notice has been added here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update as of March 30th, 1:30PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bug Alert team is aware of claims of a PoC for a Spring core RCE. However, we are awaiting confirmation before raising any further alarms, and we have not been able to utilize the PoC successfully against real-world Spring installs that we have (legal) access to. Some security professionals have claimed, on Twitter, that they are able to utilize the PoC successfully against Spring instances running behind Tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the confusion, multiple Spring devs have publicly stated there is no known vulnerability within Spring Core, and they have also stated that yesterday's serialization-related code change &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt; an attempt a resolving an open security issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll share any further info as it comes in, but at this time we are taking a cautious approach with raising any further alarms. This is already a deeply confusing situation, and Bug Alert wants to avoid making it worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to remind readers that Bug Alert is intended to be one of the earliest sources of information, and we have to weigh the risks of being early, but being wrong. This may very well end up being a case where we are wrong, but in the moment it is hard to know what is accurate. We will continue to monitor the situation and report on new developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original notice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notice is intended to alert you that there &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be a significant issue with Spring which, if confirmed, would require immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning (New York time) on Tuesday, March 29th, 2022, a member of the security research team KnownSec posted a now-removed screenshot to Twitter purporting to show a trivially-exploited remote code execution vulnerability against Spring core, the most popular Java framework in use on the Internet. The researcher did not provide a proof-of-concept or public details. Since then, the Bug Alert team has been very closely monitoring activity and discussion in the Spring ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: the claims in the next paragraph have been refuted by the Spring team. I have left them visible for historical context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;del&gt;During our initial investigation, the Bug Alert volunteer team noted that a &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7f7fb58dd0dae86d22268a4b59ac7c72a6c22529#diff-6c2618839eda075efe4491842d3673eab8fe1e342f6d9ddc2bbda8556e595864L153"&gt;small change was introduced into the Spring codebase at roughly the same time&lt;/a&gt; which may be the patch for this particular remote code execution issue. The team believes RCE could be possible through this vector, and that this change is likely the change that is intended to resolve the issue in Spring. However, the Spring team has not yet commented and has locked/closed GitHub issues inquiring about the accuracy of the claims being made.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few minutes ago, Cyber Kendra, a cybersecurity blog, &lt;a href="https://www.cyberkendra.com/2022/03/springshell-rce-0-day-vulnerability.html"&gt;put up a new post&lt;/a&gt; detailing (translated) claims that have been circulating on Chinese blogs and media for the past several hours. This post also details some of the (unconfirmed) ways this vulnerability could be detected or mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notice is intended to prepare you for the possibility that a trivially-exploited remote code execution vulnerability may be present in one of the most widely-used pieces of open-source software. The impact of this vulnerability, if it does exist, would be significant; far in excess of the impact of Log4j or Heartbleed.&lt;/p&gt;
