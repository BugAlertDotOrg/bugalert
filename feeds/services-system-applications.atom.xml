Patches are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that a patch has been made available, it's likely that additional attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to remove Confluence Server and Data Center from being available from the Internet if they cannot be patched immediately, either by shutting them down, or by firewalling them off.&lt;/p&gt;

These vulnerabilities have been assigned a bug alert severity of 'very high'. Atlassian recommends patching affected installations immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, July 20th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/july-2022-atlassian-security-advisories-overview-1142446703.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that a hardcoded credential vulnerability exists in the Questions for Confluence application, as well as Servlet Filter bypasses in both first and third party applications tied to multiple Atlassian products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardcoded credential vulnerability stems from the use of the Questions for Confluence application with the &lt;code&gt;disabledsystemuser&lt;/code&gt; account. The fix here is to update the Questions for Confluence app to a non-vulnerable version, or to disable/delete this account. &lt;strong&gt;Uninstalling the Questions for Confluence application does not remediate this vulnerability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check for use of the &lt;code&gt;disabledsystemuser&lt;/code&gt; account, follow instructions found &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-get-a-list-of-users-with-their-last-logon-times-985499701.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is for the servlet bypasses, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. The current fix is to patch to the level indicated in the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If exploited, these servlet bypass vulnerabilities may enable attackers to perform an Authentication Bypass, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly available documentation is scarce, but the Bug Alert team has analyzed &lt;a href="https://github.com/Onapsis/onapsis_icmad_scanner/blob/master/src/ICMAD_scanner.py"&gt;the PoC&lt;/a&gt; and SAP documentation. It appears that SAP &lt;a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/e815bb97839a4d83be6c4fca48ee5777/7.5.21/en-US/4a47abb3e1f41cd4e10000000a421937.html"&gt;can utilize the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; header&lt;/a&gt; (which is usually stripped from untrusted traffic) to authenticate a user through an authenticating proxy or SSO module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, publicly available information is limited at this time, but it appears likely that this request smuggling issue could be utilized to insert the &lt;code&gt;REMOTE_USER&lt;/code&gt; request header and impersonate another SAP user, including the present-by-default 'Administrator' account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-22536. Patches are available now from the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
