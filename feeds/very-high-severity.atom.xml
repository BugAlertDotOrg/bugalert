A hardcoded credential vulnerability in Questions for Confluence, and Servlet Filter Bypass Vulnerabilities have been found in multiple Atlassian products that may enable Authentication Bypasses, XSS Attacks, and CORS attacks. These vulnerabilities have been assigned a bug alert severity of 'very high'. Atlassian recommends patching affected installations immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, July 20th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/july-2022-atlassian-security-advisories-overview-1142446703.html"&gt;Atlassian released a Security Advisory&lt;/a&gt; stating that a hardcoded credential vulnerability exists in the Questions for Confluence application, as well as Servlet Filter bypasses in both first and third party applications tied to multiple Atlassian products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardcoded credential vulnerability stems from the use of the Questions for Confluence application with the &lt;code&gt;disabledsystemuser&lt;/code&gt; account. The fix here is to update the Questions for Confluence app to a non-vulnerable version, or to disable/delete this account. &lt;strong&gt;Uninstalling the Questions for Confluence application does not remediate this vulnerability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check for use of the &lt;code&gt;disabledsystemuser&lt;/code&gt; account, follow instructions found &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-get-a-list-of-users-with-their-last-logon-times-985499701.html"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is for the servlet bypasses, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. The current fix is to patch to the level indicated in the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If exploited, these servlet bypass vulnerabilities may enable attackers to perform an Authentication Bypass, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) bypass.&lt;/p&gt;

At this time they have not released any specifics as to what the exact vulnerable endpoint is, or any indicators of compromise that could lead defenders to believe they have been exploited. There is currently no fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a patch has been made available, it's likely that additional attackers will inspect the differences in the application binaries between the fixed and vulnerable versions, and develop attack methods rapidly. This post will be updated as information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, Atlassian is advising customers to remove Confluence Server and Data Center from being available from the Internet, either by shutting them down, or by firewalling them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability been assigned CVE-2022-26134. &lt;del&gt;Patches are not yet available from the vendor&lt;/del&gt; (see last update for patch links). This notice will be updated when they are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update as of June 2nd, 10:00PM New York time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity firm Volexity has &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence/"&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing how they originally found this vulnerability being used in the wild, prior to reporting it to Atlassian. Their write-up includes IP ranges the attackers utilized, as well as some additional background information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added this flaw to its list of &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;known exploited vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; with a deadline for remediation of Friday, June 3rd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;As of this update, there is still no patch available.&lt;/del&gt; Confluence administrators are urged to remove public-facing installations from the Internet as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
